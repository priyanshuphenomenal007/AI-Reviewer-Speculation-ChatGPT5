abstract: >
  This repository documents a speculation vs. evidence failure in ChatGPT-5â€™s reviewer  
  role. While analyzing a PDF, the model correctly observed that only captions were present,  
  but went beyond the evidence by speculating on LaTeX directory issues. These hypotheses  
  were presented as facts until challenged, after which the model admitted this as a  
  review-process failure and a structural limitation of generative AI reviewers.  
  This case highlights risks of unverifiable speculation in safety-critical evaluations.
