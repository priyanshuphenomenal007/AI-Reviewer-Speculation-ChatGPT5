# Service Brief — AI-Reviewer-Speculation-ChatGPT5

## Summary  
This project documents how ChatGPT-5 drifted into **speculation**, presenting unverifiable hypotheses as facts during PDF review.  

## Key Insight  
Even when instructed to stay in “evidence-only” mode, generative AI reviewers may:  
- Extend beyond the artifact under review.  
- Conflate hypotheses with verified observations.  

## Why It Matters  
- In research, compliance, or safety audits, If speculation is not distinguished from fact, it can undermine trust in review contexts.  
- Demonstrates structural limitation: predictive reasoning cannot fully suppress speculative outputs.  

## Deliverables  
- Logs (JSONL + human-readable).  
- Screenshots of critical admissions.  
- External video evidence.  
- Cryptographic verification.
